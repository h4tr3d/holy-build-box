# Build box with GCC7 toolchain and Dynamic linking by default

This box needed to create portable binaries for modern software, that uses C++14 and C++17 features.

Needed extra packages builts too. Most packages uses from CentOS 6.

Tools like linuxdeployqt should be used to produce more-less complete binary tree. In additional,
tools like AppImage should be used to procude single self running package.
